#Description:
Furry Tails Do Come True is a search portal for rescue pets. It uses multiple APIs to retrieve info about pets available for adoption, and to locate them on a Google map. For each available pet, a marker is created on the map. Hovering over a marker opens a pop-up info window that displays a photo of the pet available at that location, as well as other associated information.
Additionally, this app uses the Youtube API to display a video related to the breed of pet queried by the user.
